This demo code implements the TwistedEquation Android 4.0 Intents demos 
numbers 63, 64, 64, 66 and 67 (parts 1 through 5)
 63: Start a second activity explicitly.
 64: Start a second activity implicitly.
 65: Start a second app to view a web page.  Set the AndroidManifest.xml
     file so it will respond to the request.
 66: Start a second activity with an intent to "share text."  Set the
     code up so it explicitly starts a 'chooser' and modify the
     AndroidManifest.xml so this app will
     respond to the request.
 67: Modify the second activity so it indicates the activity that started it.
